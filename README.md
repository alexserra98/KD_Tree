# Parallel KD_Tree
This repository contains two implementations of a parallel kd-tree using MPI and OpenMP in C++11. The work was written as an assignment of FHPC course 2021-2022 @ DSSC, Units.
## Introduction
A K-dimensional tree is a data structure widely used for partitioning and organizing
points in a k-dimensional space, they â€™re involved in many different applications
such as searches involving a multidimensional search key (e.g. range
searches and nearest neighbor searches).
